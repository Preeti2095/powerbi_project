# PowerBi_Projects
- This repo contains the powerbi projects.
- SalesInsights.pbix file is the dashboard for sales insights for the company Atliq company from year 2017 to 2020.
- PowerBi is connected to **MySQL** database to get the data into the powerbi.
- The dashboards gives report on **Revenue & Sales Qty by Market**, **Top 5 Products & Customers** and **Revenue Trend** for years 2017 to 2018.
- The **Data Model** is used to establish the relationship between tables which in turn reflected in dashboard.
- Since work mail is required to publish the dashboard, due to absence of it I have uploaded it to github. Kindly download the repo to get the powerbi file and open it in Powerbi.
